# Visual Content Strategy: Matching Form to Function

**Objective**: Ensure every concept in the Pleasure Vocabulary Builder is represented by the visual format that best maximizes understanding and "Aha!" moments.

## The Framework: Three Tiers of Fidelity
We move beyond the basic abstract icons into three categories of "Rich Media."

| Format | Purpose ("The Why") | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Interactive Diagram**<br>*(The Simulator)* | **Learning by Doing.** Allows the user to manipulate variables to understand mechanics, physics, or cause-and-effect relationships. | **Mechanics & Techniques**<br>(Angles, Friction, Depth) |
| **2. Rich Static Diagram**<br>*(The Map)* | **Clarity & Precision.** Allows for detailed anatomical labeling, data visualization, and showing complex relationships at a glance. | **Anatomy & Data**<br>(Cross-sections, Charts, Timelines) |
| **3. Abstract Motion/Video**<br>*(The Vibe)* | **Feeling & Flow.** Captures the *qualities* of an experience—rhythm, emotion, temperature—that are hard to graph or simulate. | **Sensations & Psychology**<br>(Ripples, Sparks, Calm) |

## Concept-by-Concept Plan

### 1. Techniques (The "How-To")
These concepts rely on physical understanding.

| Concept | Current State | Ideal Format | Rationale & Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Angling** | Interactive (Skia) | **Interactive** | ✅ **Done.** Physics of rotation is best felt through drag interaction. |
| **Rocking** | Interactive (Skia) | **Interactive** | ✅ **Done.** Friction/Heat feedback gamifies the subtle movement. |
| **Shallowing** | Interactive (Skia) | **Interactive** | ✅ **Done.** Counter-intuitive "depth map" needs exploration. |
| **Pairing** | Static Icon | **Rich Static Diagram** | **Plan**: A high-fidelity anatomical cross-section showing the *internal* clitoral structure (crura) and how external touch connects to it. <br>*Why Static?* The "Aha" comes from seeing the hidden anatomical connection, which requires precise labeling, not necessarily motion. |
| **Golden Trio** | Static Icon | **Rich Static Infographic** | **Plan**: A stylized Venn diagram or "Equation" visual (Vagina + Hand + Oral = Peak). <br>*Why Static?* It's a formula/recipe. Simplicity and clarity are key here. |

### 2. Sensations (The "Feeling")
These concepts describe internal states.

| Concept | Current State | Ideal Format | Rationale & Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Building** | Video Prop | **Abstract Motion** | **Plan**: A generated loop of a wave or flame gathering intensity. <br>*Why Motion?* Static images fail to capture the *temporal* aspect of "gradual increase." |
| **Plateauing** | Static Icon | **Rich Static Chart** | **Plan**: A clean, elegant line graph (Time vs. Arousal) clearly showing the "flat line" phase. <br>*Why Static?* The shape of the graph *is* the concept. |
| **Edging** | Static Icon | **Interactive** | **Plan**: A "Throttle" or "Tachometer" interface. Drag up to Red Line, release to Green. <br>*Why Interactive?* Edging is a control loop. Doing it on screen mimics the physical discipline. |
| **Spreading** | Static Icon | **Abstract Motion** | **Plan**: A seamless loop of ink diffusing in water or light rippling outward. <br>*Why Motion?* "Radiating" is inherently valid. |
| **Pulsing** | Static Icon | **Abstract Motion** | **Plan**: A rhythmic, beating visual texture (synced to ~0.8s). <br>*Why Motion?* Static pulses look like targets. Motion *feels* like a heartbeat. |

### 3. Timing & Pacing (The "When")
These concepts deal with time and sequence.

| Concept | Current State | Ideal Format | Rationale & Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Warm-up Window** | Static Icon | **Rich Static Infographic** | **Plan**: A timeline comparison. Top: "Genital Arousal" (Slow curve). Bottom: "Mental Interest" (Fast curve). Show the gap. |
| **Responsive Desire** | Video Prop | **Abstract Motion** | **Plan**: Visual of a dormant coal glowing *only* when wind/friction touches it. <br>*Why Motion?* Shows the causality (Context -> Desire). |
| **Spontaneous Desire** | Video Prop | **Abstract Motion** | **Plan**: A lightning strike or sudden bloom from void. |

### 4. Psychological (The "Mind")
These concepts are abstract and internal.

| Concept | Current State | Ideal Format | Rationale & Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spectatoring** | Static Icon | **Interactive** | **Plan**: A "Focus Pull" interaction. The screen is split/blurred. You must swipe to align the "Observer" ghost with the "Self." <br>*Why Interactive?* It creates a tangible metaphor for a mental act. |
| **Embodied Presence** | Static Icon | **Abstract Motion** | **Plan**: Deep, slow, grounded visuals. Earthy textures, slow breathing motion. |
| **Non-concordance** | Static Icon | **Rich Static Diagram** | **Plan**: A split-screen medical illustration. "Brain: No" (Blue) vs "Genitals: Yes" (Red). <br>*Why Static?* It needs to explicitly separate two systems to validate the experience. |
| **Sex Self-Esteem** | Static Icon | **Rich Static Art** | **Plan**: A metaphorical illustration (e.g., Kintsugi gold repair or a glowing silhouette) representing wholeness. |

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Interactive Polish (Current)
*   Finish Angling/Shallowing/Rocking.
*   **Next Up**: "Edging" (High value game mechanic) or "Spectatoring" (Strong psychological metaphor).

### Phase 2: The "Rich Static" Library
*   **Action**: We lack high-quality anatomical assets.
*   **Task**: Create/Source a coherent set of medical-style illustrations (Pelvis cross-sections) sharing the same style:
    *   **Palette**: `neutral[50]` background, `neutral[900]` lines, `primary[500]` highlights.
    *   **Style**: Minimalist, elegant, non-clinical but accurate.
*   **Priority Targets**: **Pairing** (Anatomy) and **Warm-up Window** (Chart).

### Phase 3: Motion Texture Loops
*   **Action**: Generate or source 5-10s seamless loops for sensations.
*   **Priority Targets**: **Building**, **Spreading**, **Pulsing**.
